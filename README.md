# Slow Travel Berlin Listings

## A new newsletter template to send weekly listings

This template is tailored for the Campaign Monitor web editor, for an overview of available HTML tags see [here](https://slowtravelberlin.createsend.com/help/topic.aspx?t=129).

All recent assets have been included in the repository, see [assets](https://github.com/Roelven/slowtravelberlin-listings/tree/master/assets).

From Emilia:

> The text should be coming in next week. I will copy fit it just to make sure and will send you a JPG as a guide. The template should not change, however.

The following remain the same each issue and can be included in the template:
* Main logo
* Pink circle
* Day headings
* Side bar headings
* Dividing lines
* Caveat
